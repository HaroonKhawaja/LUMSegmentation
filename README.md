# ðŸŒ¿ LUMSegmentation: Semantic and Instance Segmentation of Field-Collected Plant Data

**LUMSeg** is a deep learning project focused on semantic and instance segmentation of plant imagery collected from LUMS agricultural fields. 
Conducted as part of a Directed Research Project (DRP), this work involved end-to-end data handling â€” from raw image preprocessing and annotation to deep model experimentation and optimization.

## Project Description

This project began with a collection of raw plant images provided by my DRP instructor, captured from agricultural fields at LUMS. The dataset required significant manual effort, including:

- **Cleaning and preprocessing** of raw field images.
- **Manual annotation** for semantic segmentation and instance segmentation.

Multiple model architectures were explored:
- **U-Net-inspired model with LSTM units** to capture contextual dependencies and generate the masks.
- **Standard Mask R-CNN** for instance segmentation.
- **Optimized Mask R-CNN with integrated LSTM layers** for enhanced segmentation accuracy.
